# Making Your First Git Commit

Git is essential for tracking changes in your projects. Making a commit is simple once you get the hang of it.

> A Git commit captures a snapshot of your project, allowing you to review or revert changes later.

# Code Snippet

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push origin main
```

This snippet stages all changes, commits them with a message, and pushes to the main branch.
